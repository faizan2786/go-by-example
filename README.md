# Go By Example - Practical Projects

This repository is inspired by the book **[Go by Example](https://www.manning.com/books/go-by-example)** by Inac Gumus. It is my attempt of implementing the practical projects discussed in the book.


## Structure
- **Each top-level folder** represents a distinct practical Go project.
- **Each sub-folder** within a project contains different iterations, improvements, or variations of that project, allowing to see the evolution in Go code.

## Current Projects

- **hit**: A command-line tool for making HTTP requests, featuring custom argument parsing and a testable main logic for robust CLI testing.

- **url**: A custom URL parser, demonstrating how to develop and test basic utilities in Go using best practices. It also includes example tests for parallel test execution and benchmarking.
